 %Problem
 %We now use the function heat to study how the temperature distribution 
 %in a brick wall varies with time. The 
 %wall is 0.3 m thick and is initially at a uniform temperature of 100°C. 
 %For the brickwork, K = 5 × 10?7 m/s2. If the temperature of 
 %both surfaces is suddenly lowered to 20° C and kept at this temperature, we wish 
 %to plot the subsequent variation of temperature through the wall 
 %at 440 s (7.33 min) intervals for 22,000 s (366.67 min).
